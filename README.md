# **Sign2Speak(S2S)**-*Empowering Silence*
*Sign language to text and audio with Generative AI.*

# Inspiration:

The World Health Organisation stated that approximately 70 million people in the world are deaf-mutes.A total of 360 million people are deaf,and 32 million of these are children.
   
 Our idea aims to reduce the barrier of  communication faced by deaf-mutes around the globe.
 
 Our project revolves around building a sign language to text and speech converter.It will implement features of Machine Learning and generative AI to take Sign Language as the input using the Computer camera and converts the given input to text and then to speech instataneously

## Future Prospects
The future prospects of sign language to text converters looks promising.Advances in machine learning and computer vision can enhance accuracy,enabling seamless communication between deaf and hearing communities.

Integration into various devices and platforms could make sign language more accessible globally,fostering inclusivity and breaking communication barriers.Ongoig research and development are likely to refine these technologies ,making them more user-friendly and widely adopted.
